# Arena Names

Could be constructed from various parts. For example:

> Horrific Blood Ring of Albion

or

> Gruesome Fighters Pit of Dundee

So the typical arena name would look like this "`<prefix>` `<arena_type>` of `<region>`" where each of these variables could have an effect on the arena properties.

There could also be "named" arenas, which are always the same. They would have an unique recognizable name and naming schema and should provide a challenge for characters.
