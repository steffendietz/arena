# Start Playing

Ability to start playing immediately. No Account creation.
Clicking the 'Start playing' button creates a `Character` and temporary `User` (for WS connection) and
transports the user to the Character screen.
From there the `User` can be turned into an account by providing email and password.

# Arena Names

Could be constructed from various parts. For example:

> Horrific Blood Ring of Albion

or

> Gruesome Fighters Pit of Dundee

So the typical arena name would look like this "`<prefix>` `<arena_type>` of `<region>`" where each of these variables could have an effect on the arena properties.

There could also be "named" arenas, which are always the same. They would have an unique recognizable name and naming schema and should provide a challenge for characters.
